# Brazilian Anagram Calculate 

This is a simple project to calculate how many anagrams a word have and validate how many created words really exist by a dictionary api call.

## Cache

How this basic service needs to validating any word in a dictionary api, the requests could take to long. To avoid that, or better, to minimize, I used cache to storage all api calls. 


## Security

I used spring security to create a user/pass in memory validating. 

Use this information to make the request:

- User: admin
- password: password

## Build with
- Java
- Spring
